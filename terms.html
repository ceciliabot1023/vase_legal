    <h3 id="1">1. OUR SERVICES</h3>

    <p><strong>MyVase is an emotional performance utility, not a medical device.</strong> The App is a productivity tool
        designed to provide guided reset sessions to help professionals mentally transition between work segments.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>It is <strong>not</strong> intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease or mental health
            condition. The App is <strong>not a replacement for professional therapy</strong> or medical advice.</li>
        <li><strong>Not for Emergencies:</strong> Do not use the App for emergency mental health needs. If you are
            experiencing a mental health crisis, please contact your local emergency services.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>By using the Services, you acknowledge you have read and understood this disclaimer.</p>

    <h4>User Tiers</h4>

    <p>The Services are offered in two tiers:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Free Users:</strong> You may use the Services without creating an account. Access is limited to 2
            reset sessions per week. All session data is stored <strong>locally on your device</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Premium Subscribers:</strong> Paid subscribers receive unlimited access to all core and premium
            reset protocols (e.g., "Presentation Prep," "Conflict Recovery"). Your session data is stored locally on
            your device.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>No Account Required:</strong> MyVase does not require account creation. The App operates on a local-first
        privacy model where all your sensitive session data stays on your device. We collect only anonymous, aggregated
        usage data via third-party providers (TelemetryDeck) to improve our Services.</p>

    <h4>Subscriptions and Payments</h4>

    <p>We offer paid "Premium" access via auto-renewing subscriptions and one-time lifetime payments. All payments are
        processed by <strong>Apple Inc.</strong> through the App Store.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>1.1 Subscription Plans:</strong> We offer various auto-renewing subscription plans. The current
            price and billing cycle for each plan are displayed within the App and at the point of purchase.</li>
        <li><strong>1.2 Lifetime Purchase:</strong> We may offer a one-time "Lifetime" purchase for permanent access to
            Premium features. The current price for this option is displayed within the App.</li>
        <li><strong>1.3 Payment and Subscription Management:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>By making a purchase, you agree to Apple's Terms of Sale. Your Apple ID account will be charged at
                    the time of purchase confirmation.</li>
                <li><strong>Subscriptions automatically renew</strong> unless auto-renew is turned off in your Apple ID
                    Account Settings at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period.</li>
                <li><strong>You must manage and cancel subscriptions</strong> through your Apple ID Account Settings. We
                    cannot manage or cancel your subscriptions for you.</li>
                <li><strong>No Refunds:</strong> We do not provide refunds for unused portions of a subscription period.
                    All refund requests are subject to Apple’s refund policies and must be submitted to Apple.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

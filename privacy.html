    <h3 id="1">1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h3>
    <p>Vase is built on a <strong>local-first privacy architecture</strong>. This means all of your personal session data stays on your device. We do not have access to it.</p>
    <h4>A. Information Stored ONLY On Your Device (Local Data)</h4>
    <p>This is your private data. It is stored in the App's secure container on your iPhone (using Core Data and UserDefaults) and <strong>never transmitted to our servers</strong>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Reset Session Data:</strong> Session type (e.g., core reset, premium protocol), duration, completion status, and timestamps.</li>
        <li><strong>User Settings:</strong> Audio, notification, and display preferences.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Tracking:</strong> A local-only counter for your weekly reset count (to enforce tier limits) and the week's start date.</li>
        <li><strong>Subscription Status:</strong> A local copy of your current tier (guest/free/premium) and expiration date, validated by StoreKit.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>B. Information Stored On Our Servers (Authentication Data)</h4>
    <p>To provide account services (for Registered Free Users and Premium Subscribers), we collect the following <strong>minimal</strong> data using <strong>Firebase Authentication</strong>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User ID:</strong> A unique identifier assigned by Firebase.</li>
        <li><strong>Authentication Provider:</strong> The method you used (e.g., email/password, Apple Sign In).</li>
        <li><strong>Email Address:</strong> Your email address, <em>only</em> if you use email/password login.</li>
        <li><strong>Timestamps:</strong> Your account creation date and last sign-in timestamp.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>C. How Data is Handled by User Tier</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Guest Users:</strong> All data is stored locally. Session data is <strong>automatically deleted after 7 days</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Registered Free Users:</strong> Authentication data is stored on Firebase. Session data is stored <strong>locally and permanently</strong> (until you delete the app).</li>
        <li><strong>Premium Subscribers:</strong> Same as Registered Free Users.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="2">2. HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>
    <p>We process your information for very limited purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Data</strong> is processed <strong>on your device</strong> to provide app features, such as showing your session history and enforcing weekly reset limits.</li>
        <li><strong>Server Data</strong> (Authentication) is processed <strong>only</strong> to allow you to sign in, sign out, and manage your account.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="3">3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Contractual Necessity (to provide the App):</strong> We process your Account History and Authentication Data to fulfill our "contract" with you, which is to provide a working app, sync your data, and verify your subscription.</li>
        <li><strong>Legitimate Interest (to improve the App):</strong> We have a legitimate business interest in processing anonymous Usage and Diagnostics Data to understand how our App is used, to fix crashes, and to make our product better.</li>
        <li><strong>Consent (for marketing):</strong> If you opt-in to our marketing emails, we will use your email address based on your explicit consent, which you can withdraw at any time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="4">4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h3>
    <p>We <strong>do not sell your data</strong>. We only disclose minimal data to the essential service providers needed to run the App.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Firebase Authentication (Google LLC):</strong> We disclose your email (if used) and authentication tokens to Firebase <em>only</em> for the purpose of logging you in. They do not receive any of your session data.</li>
        <li><strong>Apple Inc. (StoreKit & Sign In):</strong> If you use "Sign in with Apple," we receive your Apple-provided user ID and optional email. If you subscribe, Apple processes your payment. We <strong>never</strong> see your credit card or financial data. We only receive a digital receipt from Apple to validate your purchase.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="5">5. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</h3>
    <p><strong>No.</strong> We do not use advertising identifiers, cookies, web beacons, or any other technology for tracking or analytics.</p>
    <p>Firebase Authentication uses secure tokens to keep you logged in. These are a necessary part of account security and are not used for tracking or advertising.</p>

    <h3 id="6">6. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?</h3>
    <p>We offer "Sign in with Apple." If you use it, we receive your Apple-provided User ID and your email (either your real one or a private relay, based on your choice). This information is used <em>only</em> for account creation and authentication.</p>

    <h3 id="7">7. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Data (Guests):</strong> Automatically deleted from your device after 7 days.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Data (Registered/Premium):</strong> Stored on your device <strong>permanently</strong>, until you delete the App from your iPhone.</li>
        <li><strong>Server Data (Authentication):</strong> Kept for as long as your account is active. If you delete your account, this data is permanently deleted from our servers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="8">8. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h3>
    <p>We protect your data in two ways:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>By Not Collecting It:</strong> The best way we keep your sensitive session data safe is by <strong>never collecting it</strong>. It never leaves your device.</li>
        <li><strong>By Securing What We Must:</strong> The minimal Authentication Data we store is managed by Google's Firebase, which uses industry-standard security measures (encryption in transit and at rest).</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 id="9">9. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h3>
    <p>Our App is not marketed to or intended for children under 13, in compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). We do not knowingly collect any data from children under 13. If we learn we have inadvertently collected authentication data from a child under 13, we will delete it.</p>

                <li><strong>Full Data Erasure:</strong> You can delete <strong>all local session data</strong> by uninstalling the App from your iPhone.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="11">11. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h3>

    <h3 id="12">12. DO UNITED STATES RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h3>
    <p>Yes (CCPA/CPRA). As a California resident, you have the right to know what data is collected.</p>
    <ul>
